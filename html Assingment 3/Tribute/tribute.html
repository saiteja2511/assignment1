               <p><b>Hrithik Roshan</b> <i>(English: /ˈrɪtɪk ˈrɒʃən/, born 10 January 1974)     </i>is an Indian actor who works in Hindi films. 
                He has portrayed a variety of characters and is known for his dancing skills. One of the highest-paid actors in India,
                he has won many awards, including six Filmfares, four for Best Actor and one each for Best Debut and Best Actor (Critics).
                Starting in 2012, he appeared several times in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 based on his income and popularity.
                </p>
                <p>In his early 20s, he was diagnosed with scoliosis that would not allow him to dance or perform stunts. Initially devastated,
                    he eventually decided to become an actor anyway. Around a year after the diagnosis, he took a chance by jogging on a beach
                    when he was caught in a downpour. There was no pain, and becoming more confident, he was able to increase his pace with no adverse 
                    effects. Roshan sees this day as "the turning point of life."

                    the life force and peace and excitement of just being - to be so much a part of nature 
                    that the mere thought of chemical crutches like cigarettes and drugs automatically seem
